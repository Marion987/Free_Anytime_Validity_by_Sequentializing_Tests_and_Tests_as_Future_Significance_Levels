#Section 5.3 gluing the z-test for increasing levels
#plot the time we stop for gluing the seq. z-test if we define a new test each time we reach 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and then conclude with a tradional z-test based on 15 data points 
#i.e. we compute the seq. z-test for the data, if we reach a new desired level, we define a new one and so on
#for testing m端 <= 0 against m端 > 0
